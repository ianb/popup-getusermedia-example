# popup-getusermedia-example

A small extension to demonstrate that a popup can't use getUserMedia. OR MAYBE IT CAN?!?!?

## Using this

To get running:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

will launch a new browser with the extension installed. Click the upside-down mic icon.

The status will show if it gets a media stream. Try opening the popup in a tab, using the link in the popup.

Various odd things may occur. I haven't figured out exactly how everything works.
